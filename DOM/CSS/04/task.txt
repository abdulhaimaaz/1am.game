Here's your mission: build the pricing section for a gym website. You know, one of those rows of three cards that shows different membership options. We're calling our gym "Flexbox Fitness" (of course).

Hereâ€™s what you need to do:

Create a row of three pricing cards. On a desktop, they should sit side-by-side. On a phone, they should stack vertically. The middle card needs to be a bit bigger to stand out. All cards should always be the same height, no matter how much text is inside.

Copy and paste this to get going. Save it as index.html

Nail these in your style.css file:

[ ] Turn .pricing-container into a flexbox parent

[ ] Make the cards sit in a row on desktop

[ ] Make the cards stack on mobile (hint: media query or flex-wrap)

[ ] Center the row of cards on the page

[ ] Make all cards the same height (this should happen automatically)

[ ] Make the middle card (.highlight) wider than the others (use flex-grow or flex-basis)

[ ] Style the cards nicely - add some padding, a border, background color

[ ] Make the button in the middle card a different color

Feeling confident? Try these:

- Add a subtle shadow to make the cards pop off the page

- Put a "MOST POPULAR" badge on the middle card

1. Start with the container! Make it flex first, then worry about the items inside.

2. Use your browser dev tools. Right-click -> Inspect is your best friend for debugging layout.

3. Resize your browser window constantly to test how it looks on mobile.

You've got this. Make it look clean and professional. Can't wait to see what you build!
